# Jekyll App Site

The Jekyll App Site is a small Jekyll template to present an iPhone app with a static site, made by **JP Simard**.

There are indeed very few differences between my fork and his project, which are:

* Ready to use `assets`, no need to build in **rake** (removed from `.gitignore`)
* Updated with Jet Black **iPhone 7** frame
* Added Gold **iPhone 5S** frame *(not used)*
* Updated jquery from `2.0.3` up to `3.3.1`
* Updated the date, from static *`2014`* to Jekyll dynamic year
* Added an entry in `_config.yml` to choose the icon path
* Switched from `redcarpet` to `kramdown` **markdown** language
* Added `rouge` highlight method *(not needed though)*
* Added `rake` and `rsync` as **`plugins`** in `_config.yml`

The gh-pages branch contains all the assets already built, ready to use with Github Pages.
